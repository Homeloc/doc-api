How to build the documentation:
- Clone the repo
- Create a virtualenv
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- cd into docs and run `make html`

Documentation is built into docs/_build/html

Once you push changes here, a webhook should build the documentation here: https://homeloc-api-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
