Test server
===========

In order to test our APIs and not pollute production servers, a test server is at your disposal. This server is there to test the POST calls you will make to the API. For GET calls, you can access the production data directly.

**Warning**: This test server is our staging server. Some downtime is expected, and the SSL certificate might not be valid. If you are facing major issues to access this server, contact your Homeloc contact.
