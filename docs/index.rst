Welcome to Homeloc's api documentation!
===================================

Welcome to the Homeloc API documentation :)
Here you will learn how to import data from our servers and ultimately take bookings using our stock control.

Note that our API is private, and you will need a login and a password to be able to access it.
Ask your Homeloc contact for one if you haven't already.

Our APIs rely on `Django Rest Framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_. Thus you should be able to explore the API with your browser by just going to our APIs url. This might come in handy :)

The public Github repository for this documentation can be found `here <https://github.com/Homeloc/doc-api/>`_. Do not hesitate to report issues in this documentation there.
